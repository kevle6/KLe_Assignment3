#In Class Programming Assignment 3: Loops; Exercise #1

#Purpose: This program asks the user to enter a username, password,
#and answers to three security questions to be stored into the program.
#Then, the program will prompt the user to sign into their username and password.
#The program will stop anyone from "logging into" a username if they
#do not get the password or any three security questions correct.

print("\n\nThe programâ€™s main purpose is to secure your username and password against hackers.") #Explanation of the program

#Program prompts User to create new Username and Password.
username = input("\nCreate a new Username: \n\n")
password = input("\nCreate a new Password: \n\n")

print("\nTHE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE CASE SENSITIVE.") #Explain that answers must have the same character case to be correct.

#Program asks three security questions to verify authorized users.
question_1 = input("\nSecurity Question 1: What is your Favorite Food? \n\n")
question_2 = input("\nSecurity Question 2: What Month were you Born in? \n\n")
question_3 = input("\nSecurity Question 3: What is Your Mother's Maiden Name? \n\n")

#Program prompts User to Sign In using stored Username and Password.
username_login = input("\nEnter your username: \n\n")

#Loop used to have User retype username if inputted username does not match the stored username.
while username_login != username:
    username_login = input("\nThis username does not exist. Try again:\n\n")

#After User enters stored username, program prompts for password.
password_login = input("\nEnter your password: \n\n")

#Conditions for Password if Password is Incorrect.
